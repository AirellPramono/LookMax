"For a formal occasion with the current weather conditions of 6.9\u00b0C and overcast clouds, it's essential to prioritize warmth and a polished appearance. Given your wardrobe collection, I recommend the following outfit combination:\n\n**Top:**  \n- **Type:** Jacket  \n- **Color:** Black  \n- **Material:** Knit  \n- **Description:** A relaxed-fit black knit jacket providing comfort and warmth with a modern look. This jacket will not only keep you warm in the cool temperature but also offers a sophisticated appearance suitable for formal settings.\n\n**Middle:**  \n- **Type:** Shirt  \n- **Color:** White  \n- **Material:** Cotton  \n- **Description:** A classic white polo shirt with a collared neck, offering a smart yet casual appearance. The white color maintains a professional and clean look, pairing well with the black jacket.\n\n**Bottom:**  \n- **Type:** Pants  \n- **Color:** Dark  \n- **Material:** Cotton or lightweight fabric  \n- **Description:** Casual pants that are comfortable and suitable for everyday wear, which also pair well with the shirt for a laid-back look. Opt for a darker shade to keep the outfit cohesive and appropriate for the formal occasion.\n\nThis combination provides a polished yet comfortable outfit that balances the need for warmth with an appropriate formal presentation."
